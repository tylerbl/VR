<h1>Virtual Reality and The Digital Scholarship Commons</h1>

<h2>Tyler’s Initial Ideas </h2>

<h3>Blogging </h3>

<p>Creating short, simple, and easy to read blog posts to discuss VR topics. Potential topics:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>What’s happening with VR on campus</strong> (the who, what, where, why, when). Mostly promotional content. </li>
	<li><strong>Exploring the Field:</strong> Short notes and diary-like entries about my “experimentations” using VR. </li>
	<li><strong>VR Roundups:</strong> roundups on recent VR journalism, academic publications, new application releases, new books releases, videos, conferences, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>VR Reading List</h3>

<p>Curating an ongoing VR reading list with UVic library links. This would be ideal for the student, faculty, etc. who want to start reading widely in VR academic literature across disciplines. </p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>What might the DSC need in terms of documentation for VR? For example: </p>

<ul>
	<li>VR best practices and safety protocols.</li>
	<li>How to maintain VR hardware and software.</li>
	<li>Using VR for the first time: guides to newcomers (researchers, student projects, the public, etc.). </li>
	<li>Contact database: who on campus as well as in the community has VR equipment, research expertise, is doing creative or professional work, etc. Researching where and what kinds of things are being done with VR in Victoria. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Needs?</h3>

<p>What other related areas can I try and help or be of use? e.g. 3D photogrammetry, 3D scanning.</p>

<h3>Keep Me In Mind</h3>

<p>A couple of other branching things that I wouldn’t mind exploring in the future if anyone was interested. </p>

<p><br/><strong>CAQDAS:</strong> I have some level of familiarity with Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis or CAQDAS. For example: <a href="https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo/home">Nvivo</a>, <a href="https://atlasti.com/">Atlas.ti</a>, <a href="https://www.quirkos.com/index.html">Quirkos</a>. If there is a need I would be excited to help undergraduate or graduate students in this area or in general how qualitative data analysis is changing in regard to all things digital. </p>

<p><strong>Game Studies 101:</strong> I use video games in my research methods I would be happy to speak with anyone looking to do something similar or who have general questions about the field of <em>game studies</em> and what kinds of things are being done. </p>
