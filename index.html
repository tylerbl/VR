<h1>Virtual Reality and The Digital Scholarship Commons</h1>

<h2>Tyler’s Initial Ideas </h2>

<h3>Blogging </h3>

<p>Creating short, simple, and easy to read blogs on relevant VR topics. Potential topics:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>What’s happening with VR on campus</strong> (the who, what, where, why, when). Mostly promotional content. </li>
	<li><strong>Exploring the Field:</strong> Short notes and journal like entries on my own “experimentations” using VR. </li>
	<li><strong>VR Roundups:</strong> short roundups on recent VR journalism, academic publications, new application releases, new books releases, videos, conferences, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>VR Reading List</h3>

<p>Curating a reading list on VR with permanent UVic library links. This would be ideal for the student, faculty, etc. who want to start reading widely in academic literature across disciplines that concern VR. </p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>What might the DSC need in terms of documentation for VR? For example: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Library VR best practices and safety protocols.</li>
	<li>How to maintain VR hardware and software.</li>
	<li>Using VR for the first time: guides to newcomers (researchers, student projects, the public, etc.). </li>
	<li>Contact database: who on campus as well as in the community has VR equipment, research expertise, is doing creative or professional work, etc. Researching where and what kinds of things are being done with VR in Victoria. </li>
</ul>
